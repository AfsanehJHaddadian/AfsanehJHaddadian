I am a UX Researcher based in Seattle. I am curious and excel well in environments that enable collective problem-solving, and I advocate for it. 
I have explored insights about users through a variety of methods including interviews, surveys, data analysis, usability studies, diary studies, and ethnographic observation, or new methods.
I bring more than 10 years of qualitative and quantitative research and methods skills in conducting generative, evaluative, and strategic research.
I have owned the research process from screening participants and defining test plans to analyzing data and synthesizing result is a fast-paced environment. 
I am independent and value humility. 
I have presented to multiple audiences (+1000) in workshops, universities, and conferences.
